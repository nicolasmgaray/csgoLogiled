# csgoLogiled

C# .NET integration for CS:GO and Logitech RGB pheriperals.

Didn´t like the original integration from Logitech since its a little Gimmicky and don´t support zone-based RGB; So I made my own using their SDK.

# Instructions

For it to work you need to put the .cfg file inside the "csgo\cfg\" directory of the game; Then just start the program and press "Start Server" button.

# Already Done

* On idle the color is set to the current team (CT/T)
* On bomb plant starts glowing red 
* On bomb defuse it glows green

# Roadmap

* Add visual indications to illustrate the difference between alive allies and alive enemies. (i.e more red in clutch sitation, more green when almost all enemies died)

* Make the bomb plant animation more dynamic

* Add feedback for health

* Add feedback for ammo
